# Geospatial Analysis Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of notebooks and scripts designed to perform **geospatial analysis** using both vector and raster layers. The included projects demonstrate the use of key tools and techniques to process, analyze, and generate valuable geospatial products for various professional contexts.

## Objective
The primary goal of this portfolio is to highlight my skills in processing and analyzing geospatial data, focusing on **workflow automation** and the **creation of high-value derived products** for the geospatial sector.

## Current Content

### 1. WMS/WCS Data Download and Processing
- **Description**: Two notebooks demonstrating how to connect to WMS/WCS services to download geospatial data (such as orthophotos or Digital Terrain Models - DTMs), process them, and generate derived products.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - `GDAL` for raster data management.
  - `Rasterio` for reading and writing raster data.
  - `Geopandas` for vector layer manipulation.
- **Generated Products**:
  - RGB orthomosaics.
  - Derived maps such as hillshades or slope maps from DTMs.

## Future Content
Planned updates will include notebooks and scripts focused on:

### 1. Change Detection with Satellite Imagery
- **Objective**: Use satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) to detect changes in vegetation, urbanization, or water resources.
- **Techniques**:
  - Calculating indices such as NDVI and NDBI.
  - Temporal analysis to identify patterns and trends.

### 2. Geospatial Analysis with Vector Layers
- **Objective**: Automate spatial analyses using vector layers, such as proximity calculations, spatial intersections, and buffer generation.
- **Applications**:
  - Environmental management.
  - Urban and regional planning studies.

## Technologies and Libraries
This portfolio is developed primarily in **Python**, utilizing the following specialized libraries:
- **`GDAL`**: Processing raster and vector data.
- **`Rasterio`**: Reading, writing, and analyzing rasters.
- **`Geopandas`**: Manipulating and analyzing vector data.
- **`Matplotlib`**: Visualizing geospatial data.

## How to Run
To reproduce the notebooks and scripts:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/aitorandreu/portfolio.git
     ```
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Set Up Input Data**:
   - Ensure input data is placed in the appropriate folders (`input/`) as described in each notebook.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open the notebooks in Jupyter or any compatible environment and follow the instructions to reproduce the analyses.
